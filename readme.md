### TODO:

* Feature Space
    - [x] NAN from dataset handling (Missing data)
    - [ ] Outliers (Wrong data handling)
    - [ ] Normalization of data (非常重要! refer to https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nJ411z7fe?p=14)
    - [ ] Dimension Reduction (PCA)
    
* Model Choice
    - [ ] LASSO (1-norm for regularization)
    - [ ] Ridge Regression (2-norm for regularization)
    - [ ] Neural Network (大力出奇迹)
